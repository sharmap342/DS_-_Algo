# DS_and_Algo_Python
             
This repository contains 4 notebooks each of which explains different algorithms and data structures. These algorithms and data structures are alos implemented using python in the given notebooks.              
Each notebook first explains the concepts behind data sturucture or algorithm and then python is used for there practical implimentation.               

## DS_&_Algo_Part1       
This notebook contains definations of data structure, algorithm, and concepts behind algorithm analysis.           
Different seraching and sorting algorithms are described and implemented here.                     
Next different types of linked lists are described and implemented in this notebook.                   
These data structures are implemented using classes in python and mulitple methods are implemented to reterive or update the status of data structure.                 
              
## DS_&_Algo_Part2               
This notebook describes concepts behind stacks and queue data structures.                   
Stacks are implemented using arrays and linked list in python here.                    
Different types of queue data structure are also described and implemented here.              
            
## DS_&_Algo_Part3             
This notebook describes ins and outs behind tree data structure. Different terminologies behind tree data structures are described here.           
Different types of binary trees and there repersentation is also described here in detail.               
Different types of binary trees are implemented using python clasees. Different methods to reterive and update the status of trees are also described here.         
Finally the concepts of restructuring a tree is described here.              
                       
## DS_&_Algo_Part4                  
This notebook describes concepts behind priority queues, heaps, hashing, and Graphs.               
The first part of notebook implements heaps using python classes. Different methods are also implemented to for insertion, deletion and getting a maximum element from a heap.    
The second part of notebook describes different types of graphs with terminologies.         
These different types of graphs are implemented in python using classes. Different methods are also defined in classes for graph traversal.
